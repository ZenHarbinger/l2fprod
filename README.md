# l2fprod
Fork and Extension of l2fprod's Java properties editing component.

I found this source somewhere on the Internet after looking for a property editor for Java.
Originally it came from [l2fprod](http://www.l2fprod.com/common/), but it is no longer available for download there.
I honestly don't remember where I found the source anymore, but the available sources on [Maven](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.l2fprod.common/l2fprod-common-shared/6.9.1) don't seem to have the PropertySheet editing source anymore.  There is a package avaiable by [another third party though](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.nuiton.thirdparty/l2fprod-common/0.1).

I have been working w/ this code for a while and have updated some of it to Java7 I think.  I have been using it in a project for work.  Changes are made as needed.
